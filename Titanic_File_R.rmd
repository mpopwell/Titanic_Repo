## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(knitr)
library(RColorBrewer)

train <- read.csv("train.csv", sep = ",")

train$FTDeckEmb = paste(train$Embarked, substring(train$Cabin, 0,1), sep = "_")

str(train)
```


```{r pressure1, echo=TRUE}
summary(train)
#Mean value of Deceased Fare, trimming bottom/top 20% to minimize outliers.
with(train, round(mean(train$Fare[train$Survived == 0], trim = .2),2))
#Mean value of Survived Fare, trimming bottom/top 20% to minimize outliers.
with(train, round(mean(train$Fare[train$Survived == 1], trim = .2),2))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure2, echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2)) 

hist(train$Age[train$Survived == 0],main="Age of Deceased", xlab = "", col = "red")
hist(train$Age[train$Survived==1],main="Age of Survived",xlab = "", col="green")
with(train, boxplot(train$Age[train$Survived == 0 & train$Age < 65], main="Age of Deceased", xlab = "", col = "red"))

with(train, boxplot(train$Age[train$Survived == 1  & train$Age < 65], main="Age of Survived", xlab = "", col = "green"))




par(mfrow = c(2,2))


with(train, hist(train$Fare[train$Survived == 0], main="Fare of Deceased", xlab = "", col = "red"))
     
with(train, hist(train$Fare[train$Survived == 1], main="Fare of Survived", xlab = "", col = "green"))

with(train, boxplot(train$Fare[train$Survived == 0 & train$Fare < 150], main="Fare of Deceased", xlab = "", col = "red"))

with(train, boxplot(train$Fare[train$Survived == 1 & train$Fare < 150], main="Fare of Survived", xlab = "", col = "green"))

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
